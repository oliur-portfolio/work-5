                                            <p>2. To maintain a mutually beneficial and constructive working relationship The Company agrees that during the currency of this agreement and for ten years after the date of completion of this agreement, for
                                                any reason whatsoever, not to solicit, induce, encourage or engage directly or indirectly with any person whom The Company has become aware of in connection with Design Facility or was introduced by Design

                                        <li>
                                            <h5>8. Fees</h5>
                                            <p>1. Design Facility's charges are computed on the basis of the time spent on The Company's affairs (which depend on the levels of skill and responsibility involved) and disbursements incurred in connection with
                                                the engagements. The rate of pay of such time to be spent shall be mutually agreed between the Client and Design Facility within a quotation/proposal document or via email communication. If a stage payment
                                                system is agreed, Design Facility will issue invoices at mutually agreed intervals during the course of the project, as and when each section of work is completed and approved. Each stage needs to be fully
                                                paid prior to the next stage starting. Failure to pay will result in all works being halted until payments have fully cleared.</p>

                                            <p>2. For all projects that have been quoted with a 50% installment to be paid in advance, the payment must be made upon agreeing the project quote. Work will not commence until the payment has cleared by the bank.
                                                After work has commenced, the deposit is deemed non-refundable. If no work has commenced, you are entitled to a full refund of your installment, which will be paid upon notice of termination. If the project
                                                is terminated before the midpoint of the project as determined by the project timeline, Design Facility will calculate the hours spent against the installment and refund the value of the hours not used.</p>

                                            <p>3. The Company agrees that project/work is deemed to have commenced and subject to payment once a project has been agreed and signed-off by The Company; once any work has been agreed in writing via email or
                                                any other form of written communication; once a fee payment has been made, for example the deposit amount.</p>

                                            <p>4. If under any circumstance the project is terminated by The Company without 2 weeks written notice, The Company is liable to pay for all work completed up to the date the project is terminated at Design Facility's
                                                current hourly rate set at Design Facility's discretion. If appropriate notice is given, the project costs to the date of termination will be calculated and any fees that are outstanding will be invoiced.</p>

                                            <p>5. For work produced/manufactured by a third party, once The Company has provided a purchase order or agreed to a digital production/proof document via email or paid the supplier in advance, The Company agrees
                                                to pay for the full production costs as agreed with Design Facility. The full balance of any invoices issued by Design Facility in relation to this work must be paid in full and cleared by the bank prior
                                                to delivery of the work being released to The Company.</p>

                                            <p>6. Where third party solutions/service providers are required to complete any work, their costs will be classed as associated expenses for the work and The Company agrees pay for such additional charges.</p>

                                            <p>7. If third party solutions/service providers that are used for any works are located outside of the UK, The Company agrees that the cost for the work will be dependant on the exchange rates at the date of Design
                                                Facility providing an estimate in its quotation/proposal. As exchange rates fluctuate, when the third party solution/service provider is actually acquired, Design Facility will make The Company aware of
                                                any changes to the costs due to the exchange rate and the The Company agrees to pay any extra charges should they arise.</p>

                                            <p>8. When any work or solution has been presented to The Company and Design Facility is awaiting feedback from The Company, should the feedback be delayed by more than 5 working days then The Company agrees that
                                                the work has been deemed to be accepted and is liable for payment.</p>

                                            <p>9. Prior to launch of any work/solution in the public domain, the full cost of the any work as mutually agreed should be paid and cleared by The Company.</p>

                                            <p>10. All fees must be paid within 30 days of the invoice date. Overdue invoices will face a late payment charge to the value of One Hundred British Pounds plus the current rate of Value Added Tax if fees are
                                                not paid within the due date stated on the invoice. All invoices outstanding for more than 10 working days after the due date will have a surcharge applied to the invoice of 50% of the invoice value with
                                                a minimum value of One Hundred British Pounds plus the current rate of Value Added Tax. The surcharge invoice will be issued as a separate invoice to the original. Design Facility reserves the right to charge
                                                interest at the rate for the time being applicable under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 in the case of overdue accounts. If an invoice is unpaid Design Facility also reserves the
                                                right to withhold all work and/or services and/or cease any ongoing works.</p>

                                            <p>11. Should The Company cease trading under any circumstances or default on payment, all of the directors of the company and/or the signatories of this contract and/or the signatories/recipients of the proposal,
                                                agree to be held personally liable to pay all costs incurred during the project.</p>
                                        </li>

                                        <li>
                                            <h5>9. Limitations of Liability</h5>
                                            <p>1. This sets out the entire financial liability of Design Facility (including any liability for acts or omissions of its employees, agents or consultants) to you in respect of any breach of these Terms & Conditions;
